Tag= Value|

Tags:

official Tags:
Tags are from 1 to 4999. Defined by FIX protocol.

User defined Tags:
Tags are from 5000 to 9999. Are defined by companies. They are then propsed to FIX protocol which decide whether to accept/reject.
if accepted, it can then used by other companies.

Internal use tags:
Tags over 10000, are for internal use specifically. So, it can varies from company to company.


One thing to keep in in mind, both the parties needs to be in the same version to pass the message to each other, unless one party is using 5.0


CLIENTS <---> BROKERS <--->EXCHANGE


Clients which are going to send the orders to buy and sell securities. We also refer client as customers. 
They are buy side institutions for example institutional investors, asset management firm etc.

Brokers/market Makers 
This party receives the order via FIX by their customers.
There main job is to provide fills/executions to their customer orders, either by executing from their own inventory or
by sending the order to the exchange 


Exchanges or external Destinations or Brokers/market makers
They receives the orders from brokers via FIX and provide executions.



|tag=value|tag=value|

The messages are composed with tag and value pair. Separated by delimiter |.

For example. 
|8=FIX.4.2 | 9=67 | 35=8
8, 9, 35 these are called tags
And the value on the right side of = are called the values of the tags.


A FIX message is composed of several tag=value pairs. These pairs are always divided into three distinct sections:
the Header, 
the Body 
the Trailer


A fix connection between two parties  is called a fix session.
A FIX session is layered on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP/IP1) and must always follow three steps 
1 Connection
2 Message exchange
3 Disconnection

The Initiator (i.e customer or client) initiates the connection
The Acceptor (i.e broker-dealer/Valdi) authenticates the connection request and accepts it.

Once physical connection is established between the two parties:
1. The initiator sends a Logon message to the acceptor.
2. The session acceptor authenticates the party requesting connection.
3. The acceptor issues a Logon message reply as acknowledgment that the connection request has been accepted.

The first message of a FIX session is always the connection message also referred to as Logon (35=A). 
The Logon message(35=A) authenticates a trading partner establishing a connection to a remote system.
The Logon message must be the first message sent by the application requesting to initiate a FIX session.

When Both parties are not sending any data, to maintain the connection a heartbeat message(35=0) is sent every few seconds.

There are two types of fix messages:

Session level msgs/Administrative Msgs:

These msgs are used for protocol needs.
They ensure connection b/w 2 parties(connection,dissconnection,data recovery)
They are generated from both sides of connection.

Header:
8,9,35,34,49,52,56

Body:
98,141,108
98=0(The message is not encrypted)

108=1200(There is 1200 seconds interval b/w each heartbeat)

Trailer:
10
Checksum/end of message


34=?
FIX message is identified with unique sequence number. Sequence number enable clients and server applications to make sure they recieve all msgs.
It increments during session.
Can be reset during session.
Enables each party to react missed msgs.
Enables party to synchronize when recording.
 

Admin messages:
(35=?)
Logon              =A
Heartbeat          =0
Test Request       =1
Resend Request     =2
Reject             =3
Sequence Reset     =4
Logout             =5
Order Cancel       =F
reduce/increase quantity, change limit price, change instructions(Order cancel+replace)= G


35=0
Heartbeat messages are only sent when either party has no other information to sent.
It just maintains the communication link.

35=1
If initiator doesnt receive response for hearbeat(35=0) ,it will send a test request(35=1) to reciever

35=2
resend request is sent by recieving application to ask for retranismission of messages.
Is occurs when there is a gap of sequence no ap(34=)

35=3
Reject message should be issued when a message is recieved and cannot be processed.

 


Application level msgs:
It deals with sending and recieving of trade-related information.
