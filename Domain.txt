1. Proactive Monitoring & Alerting
Proactive monitoring is important to make sure corrective steps are taken to prevent issues like not meeting SLAs (Service Level Agreements). 
More focus in this area will certainly reduce downstream issue resolution ticket volume. 
Monitoring does not necessarily means keeping eye on each and every job constantly. 
It is recommended to look for automations like developing an automated script which will send alerts to the support team periodically. 
By building checkpoints into the job stream, you’ll minimize your monitoring efforts.


2. Prioritize and Permanently Fix Issues

3. Provide Timely Status Updates
Effective communication involves all of the stakeholders. This is key to successfully managing production support. 
Open lines of communication automatically reduces pressure and gives more time to fix issues rather
than going into explanatory meetings that can last hours.

  Acknowledge the issue
  Analyze and communicate ETA
  Send status updates every 15-20mins incase issue fixing takes longer. 
  Notify all stakeholders on the resolution

Reference data encompasses a range of details such as a unique security number for the financial instrument or product being traded,
the name of the buyer, seller or 
any other party involved in the contract and the costs involved in the trade. 

Reference data can be classified as static and dynamic.

Static data – this type of data won’t change throughout the course of the transaction, and includes specifications 
such as the names of the parties contracted in the financial transaction (ie. ‘counterparties’) and those in the financial supply chain,
as well as information related to the financial products involved, such as their expiration dates or type.

Stocks have nominal value which is equal to capital of company divided by total number of shares.
This value is accounting purpose only and has nothing to do with real price of stock.

banks,founders and main partners of bank hold large portion of capital which is therefore not available on market.
The portion of stock in circulation is called the floating stock or FLOAT.

The issuer (of the bond) is a borrower of capital and is committed to paying interest to bond scbscribers.
Unlike stocks, bonds can be reimbursed.
If company goes bankrupt,bondholers are paid before shareholders.
Bondholding is less risky than stockholding.

This is the price at which the investor actually buys the bond. 
It can be different from nominal value
If issue price is less than nominal value, then bond is said to be trading in premium.

FUTURE:
Future contract is an agreement b/w 2 counterparties to exchange a product called a support/underlying instrument
at a future date and at a price established at the time of transaction.
This commitment is firm and cannot be extended upon maturity.

Future is defined as a contract, between two parties, buyer and seller 
where both the parties promise to each other of buying or selling of the financial asset at an agreed date in the future and at a set price.
As the contract is legally binding, the parties to it must perform it by transferring stock/cash respectively.

The futures contract is a standardized and transferable contract that revolves around, 
its four key elements,i.e. transaction date, price, buyer, and seller. 
The items which are traded on the stock exchange like BSE OR NSE in a future contract include currencies, commodities, stocks and other similar financial assets.
In such contracts the buyer expects the asset price to rise while the seller expects it to fall.


EX:
Orange juice seller needs 100 litres for Rs50.
He made a contract for 6 months with company to get import with current price since he afraid price might rise in future.
if price gets high, company would like to sell to some new bidders
if price gets low, juice seller wants to purchase from market directly.
Looking at this , there is a clearing house which looks after this and they charge for this called margin call or intial margin.
Usually intital margin is 5-10%.
Initial margin is difference b/w current price of future product and contract price of future product.
If any party violets the contract, this margin call is used up.
In short, in future contract maturity is fixed(price is as per contract).


OPTIONS:
The price at which buyer of option can use/exercise his rights i.e buy or sell the insturment.

2 types:
Buy option or Calls
Sell option or Puts

Ex:
Orange juice needs sugar for next 6 months.They made contract.
seller thinks:
Sugar Price would fall so lets get contract on current price/rate.
Sugar Price would rise, then i would break conract.

Buyer thinks:
Sugar Price would rise, lets sign contract with current price.
Sugar Price would fall, then i would break contract.

Whichever party pays the premium they have the right.

An exchange traded derivative where the holder of the financial asset has the right to buy or sell securities at a certain price, on or before a stipulated date is regarded as an option.
The predetermined price on which the trading is concluded is known as the strike price. 
The option can be purchased by paying an upfront cost, which is non-refundable in nature, known as premium.

The option to buy the underlying asset is call option while the option to sell the asset is put option.
In both the cases, the right of exercising the option lies with the buyer only, but he is not obligated to do so.

An ISIN is a code that uniquely identifies a specific securities issue.
The numbers are allocated by a country's respective national numbering agency (NNA).
A stock has a different ticker symbol depending on where it is traded.
Stock has only one ISIN for each security.
ISINs are used for numerous reasons including clearing and settlement.
The numbers ensure a consistent format so that holdings of institutional investors can be tracked consistent across markets worldwide.

All internationally traded securities issuers are urged to use the ISIN numbering scheme, which is now the accepted standard by virtually all countries.
The United States and Canada primarily use a similar scheme known as a CUSIP number.


ISIN is 12 digit number(2+9+1)
1st 2 digits are country code, then 9 is computer generated and final acts as a check.

An single ISIN can have multiple tickers/stock codes.





Trade initiation- The investor informs the broker firm of the security they would like to buy/sell and 
                  at what price along with other trade parameters including title of scheme, ISIN, exchange etc.,

Trade execution- The order placed is matched for the price and quantity.

Trade capture- The trade parameters are fed into the Risk Management System (RMS).

Trade enrichment- Standard Settlement Instructions (SSI) are added from the RDM (Reference Data Management).

Trade verification- Amongst other things trade parameters, whether the client placing the order has sufficient stocks to pay for the security and the limits are checked.

Trade confirmation- Trade parameters of client and counter party are checked for matching and is approved for settlement.

Trade settlement- The actual exchange between counter parties takes place—simultaneous exchange of cash versus securities for a security trade or cash versus cash for a Derivative trade.

Trade reconciliation- Involves matching ledgers against statements to ensure correct accounting of all trades booked.




“Long selling‿ means that you sell shares that you own, while “short selling‿ means you sell shares that you don’t own. Your account is short by that number of shares after your transaction if you short sell. “Long selling‿ is simply called selling, although the shares can be referred to as “long shares.‿

If you sell shares that you don’t own, you will need to buy that number of shares later to make up for the shortage in your account. 
If you think you can get them cheaper in the future, and you turn out to be correct, you will make money. When you short sell, you get paid right away.
You would use part of that money to buy the shares back later, and the rest would be profit. 
If the stock goes up instead, you would use all of that money, and then some more.

stop order ?
Stop Orders
Isn’t visible to the market

If the stock fails to reach the stop price, the order isn't executed.


Limit Orders
Visible to the market
Activates market order when stop price is met
even if the stock reached the specified limit price, your order may not be filled, because there may be orders ahead of yours. 
In that case, there may not be enough (or additional) sellers willing to sell at that limit price, so your order wouldn't be filled.
(Limit orders are generally executed on a first come, first served basis.) That said, it's also possible your order could fill at an even better price. 
For example, a buy order could execute below your limit price, and a sell order could execute for more than your limit price.


Day order
A day order is a stipulation placed on an order to a broker to execute a trade at a specific price that expires at the end of the trading day if it is not completed. 
A day order can be a limit order to buy or sell a security, but its duration is limited to the remainder of that trading day.

done for day means?
Order expired may be sent when a Good Til Date (GTD) order reaches its expiration date or a Good Til Cancel (GTC) order reaches its maximum age.
That maximum age may be broker-specific and even unspecified, e.g. until the next major software release by the broker.

Order Done for Day may be sent when a Day order is unfilled or partially filled at the end of the trading day and no further executions will be sent before the order is canceled.


cancel vs cancel-replace?
Completly cancelled all(Order Cancel)=F
reduce/increase quantity,change limit price,change instructions(Order cancel+replace)= G
